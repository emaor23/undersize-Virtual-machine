# Undersized Virtual Machines Analysis Dashboard

This repository provides dashboards and tools to analyze undersized virtual machines in your VMware environment. These dashboards help identify virtual machines that are under-provisioned, ensuring optimal performance and resource allocation.

## Features
- **Undersized VM Detection**: Identify virtual machines with insufficient CPU, memory, or storage allocation.
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Insights into right-sizing virtual machines to improve performance.
- **Detailed Analysis**: Visualizations to support decision-making on resource reallocation.

## Prerequisites
- **VMware vRealize Operations Manager**: Version 7.x or 8.x.
- **Permissions**: Ensure administrative access to import dashboards and views.

## Installation
